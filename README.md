Utility for modifying / processing the contents of Javascript objects by parsing object notation strings or globs.

Note that this class will only deal with enumerable properties of the source object; so it should be used to manipulate data objects. It will not deal with preserving the prototype-chain of the given object.

**Install via NPM**:
```shell
npm i notation --save
```

Documentation soon.
